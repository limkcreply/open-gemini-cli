# General Code Style Principles

## Key Guidelines

**Readability**: Code should be easy to read and understand by humans. Developers should steer clear of unnecessarily complicated techniques.

**Consistency**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase. Maintain uniformity in formatting, nomenclature, and organizational structure throughout projects.

**Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones. Tackle large challenges by dividing them into smaller, more manageable components.

**Maintainability**: Write code that is easy to modify and extend. Reduce interconnections between modules and keep reliance on external libraries minimal.

**Documentation**: Document *why* something is done, not just *what*. Ensure documentation remains synchronized with any code modifications made over time.
