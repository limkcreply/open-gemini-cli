description = "Undo a track's changes using git"
prompt = """
Revert the changes made for track: {{args}}

## Steps

1. Read track metadata:
   - `conductor/tracks/{{args}}/metadata.json`
   - Get the track's creation date

2. Find related git commits:
   - Look for commits since the track was created
   - Identify commits related to this track (by message or files changed)

3. Show what will be reverted:
   - List the commits
   - List the files that will be affected
   - Ask for confirmation before proceeding

4. If confirmed:
   - Use `git revert` to undo commits (preserves history)
   - OR offer to create a new branch with reverted state
   - Update track status to "reverted" in metadata.json
   - Update conductor/tracks.md

## Safety

- NEVER use `git reset --hard` (destructive)
- ALWAYS use `git revert` to preserve history
- ALWAYS ask for confirmation before reverting
- Show exactly what will be changed before doing it

## Warning

Tell the user:
"This will create revert commits for the track's changes. The original commits will remain in history. Are you sure you want to proceed?"
