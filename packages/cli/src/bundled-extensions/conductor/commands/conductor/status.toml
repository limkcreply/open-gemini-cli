Show the status of all Conductor tracks.

## Steps

1. Read `conductor/tracks.md` to get the list of tracks

2. For each track, read:
   - `conductor/tracks/<id>/metadata.json` - Status info
   - `conductor/tracks/<id>/plan.md` - Task completion

3. Display a summary:
   ```
   ## Conductor Status

   ### Active Tracks
   | Track | Status | Progress | Last Updated |
   |-------|--------|----------|--------------|
   | ... | ... | X/Y tasks | ... |

   ### Completed Tracks
   | Track | Completed | Tasks |
   |-------|-----------|-------|
   | ... | ... | ... |
   ```

4. For each active track, show:
   - Current phase
   - Next uncompleted task
   - Any blockers noted

## Output Format

Present the information in a clear, scannable format.
Count completed vs total tasks by counting `[x]` vs `[ ]` in plan.md.
